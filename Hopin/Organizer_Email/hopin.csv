Thrive Conference 2020: Live A Colorful Immigrant Life,https://hopin.to/events/thrive-conference-2020-live-a-colorful-immigrant-life,"Oct 23, 8:30PM IST IST","Oct 26, 4:30AM",,"What is Thrive Conference?

Thrive Conference is an extension of Immigrant Life, the Canadian narrative  started by Dapo Bankole on July 1st 2018 with the aim of inspiring fellow immigrants to discover actionable insights that will help them thrive and make a difference in their chosen spheres of influence. He did this by putting a spotlight on his integration experiences and that of other first-generation Canadians, mining their collective intelligence and presenting these in the form of podcasts. In the last two years, the community has continued to grow and based on the identified gap in the Canadian immigrant landscape, the idea for an annual Thrive Conference was born.

Thrive Conference is the only time that first generation Canadians and friends converge together under the same roof to learn, unlearn, and network. Thrive Conference 2020 is the first in the series of these annual events.

2020 is a remarkably interesting year – a leap year, year of the pandemic and of course, the year that first-generation Canadians are coming together for the first time to discuss their thrills, challenges and hopes for the future 

This year, thrive conference will be a three-day virtual conference that will bring together movers and shakers from around Canada that are committed to supporting first-generation Canadian immigrants in their journey of integration. This year’s event will be held between Friday, October 23rd and Sunday, October 25th.

CALLED Conference,https://hopin.to/events/called-conference,"Oct 24, 4:00AM IST IST","Oct 25, 1:00AM",,"Welcome to the CALLED Conference!
 God desires to unveil a new depth of revelation to you.  He wants you to know you that you have been called by Him.  Your calling signifies two important factors.  First, you have been chosen by Him.  To be chosen not only means that you are important to God, but more significantly, you are chosen with intentionality.  The second factor is that you have a call on your life. In other words, you were created for a purpose.  God desires to accomplish great exploits with you and through you!
 For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God (NKJV- Romans 8:19).
 The revealing of the sons of God is the manifestation of you responding to the call.  Not only is the world waiting for YOU to respond, but God is waiting for you to respond to the call.  It is for such a time as this that God has chosen you to be influential, powerful and prosperous.  
 God desires for you to see yourself as capable, intelligent, confident, and courageous.   When you see yourself from His perspective, you begin to step out to where He is leading you.  You will no longer cower to fear and doubt, but you will walk in assurance and confidence.

The old mindsets of ‘I can't do this’ or ‘I don't have what it takes to accomplish that’ will no longer belong in your thinking.  God does not think this way about you, nor should you.
 
Come join the other fearless women who are making a lifestyle change and moving with determination to accomplish the call that God has for them.",Enduring Hope Ministries,melissa@enduringhopeministries.com
